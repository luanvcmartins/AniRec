# AniRec

> An anime recommendation application for Windows and Linux developed using Electron, VueJS and Vuetify.

This project was developed by the following USP ICMC's students:

- Brucce N. dos Santos
- Julio CÃ©sar Carnevali
- Luan V. de C. Martins
- Michael J. Bianchi

It is a content filtering recommendation system for animes using transdutive learning in heterogeneous networks. You can read the unfinished paper about it in the `report_v1.pdf` file. The animes have been obtained from https://myanimelist.com website, it is incomplete and you can check it out in the `BD.json` file, no garantees of anything though.

## Wanna test?

### Windows

Just download the installer in the `build` folder and simply install the software for Windows.

### Linux

Download the `linux.zip` file from the `build` folder, unzip it and run from `anirec` file..

## FAQ

### Why did you do \$X like this?

> Because it was fast. I had only a couple of hours to make this software so I skipped quite a few good practices. As this is a software for demo presentation, I have no incentive to refactor. This might become a website late on though, but I would build it from scratch.
